            1935),
            also known as Michael I. Pupin, was a Serbian American physicist and physical chemist.</p>

        <p>Pupin is best known for his numerous patents, including a means of greatly extending the range of
            long-distance
            telephone communication by placing loading coils (of wire) at predetermined intervals along the transmitting
            wire (known as "pupinization").</p>

        <p>Pupin was a founding member of National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) on March 3, 1915, which
            later
            became NASA.</p>
